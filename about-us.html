		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>When I moved to Santa Barbara, CA, I was surprised at how few opportunities there were to play here. As I was adopted into this amazing volleyball community, I quickly realized how much local players wanted to compete . We partnered up with AVP America to help make that happen.</p>
		<p>In starting Shorebreakers Volleyball, we wanted to offer tournaments where all members of the community had a chance to play. Where they can work to get better and move their way up through divisions. From Open to Recreational 4's, there is something for everyone.</p>
		<p>We also want to create a fun experience, from the Chill Zone to Sunday Funday, from cash prizes to players parties, we want to make sure everyone is having a good time!</p>
		<p>Lastly, we want to help preserve the beautiful beaches we get to enjoy everyday. Through beach clean-ups and partnering with local organizations, Shorebreakers will be giving back.</p>
		<p>All players welcome.</p>
